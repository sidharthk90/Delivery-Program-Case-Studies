# Delivery Lead / Program Management – Case Study Portfolio

This repository presents a curated set of delivery and program execution case studies
from regulated fintech environments. The focus is on **outcomes, decision-making and
execution under ambiguity**, rather than titles, tools, or ceremonies.

Although my formal designation in these engagements was **QA Manager**, the scope of
responsibility consistently extended into **release ownership, cross-team delivery
governance and program-level execution leadership**.

multiple cross-functional teams in high-risk, regulated environments.
